Hi! I am a graduate student studying Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am currently investigating techniques to optimize neural network deployment, particularly for edge and other low power devices. I also enjoy studying Electronic Design Automation (EDA) -- particularly opportunities for integrating machine learning with the design flow.
