Hi! I am a graduate student studying Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am currently investigating techniques to optimize neural network deployment, particularly for edge and other low power devices. I also enjoy studying Electronic Design Automation (EDA) -- particularly opportunities for integrating machine learning with the design flow.

## Hobbies
- Running ðŸ‘Ÿ
  - Constantly oscillating between training for a marathon and regretting running a marathon.
  - I enjoy running with Movin' Shoes Running Club in Madison!

- Fiber arts ðŸ§¶
  - I've recently picked up crocheting and knitting!
  - See some amigurumi crochet creations I've made:
